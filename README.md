# Yrid
Yrid is rust based (bevy) game in which you play as a wizard that studies the world of magic by creating spells, solving other player's riddles and exploring the world. 
One of the main points of the game is exchanging knowledge and visiting other wizards that is why this project provides three binaries:
- client 
- server
- cosmos
By default the "client" is run. 

## Client
